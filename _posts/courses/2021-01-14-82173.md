title: Introduction to Japanese I
---
**Number**: 82-173

**Units**: 9

**Why**: Fulfills PPC in the College of Engineering. My boyfriend was planning to study in Japan.

**Workload**: Most heavy in all the gen-eds I took. Lecture was 3 hours per week; small homework per lecture, 3 compositions, 6-ish dialogue presentations, 1 final project. 6-10 hours per week; 7-8 on average.

**Comment**: This course covers the first half of *82-171: Elementary Japanese I*. It was a lot of work, though. We learned basic grammar like "blah is blah", "from... to ...", or "because". Every grammar item was being practiced a lot. If you plan to take Japanese later on, I think you might be better off taking the 12-unit 82-171 instead.
