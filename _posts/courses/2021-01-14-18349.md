title: Introduction to Embedded Systems
---
**Number**: 18-349

**Units**: 12

**Why**: A senior told me Lab 4 is an intro to OS. I wanted to see if I really want to suffer through OS. It's also an ECE software area course.

**Workload**: My partner and I spent at least 3 nights for every lab, including checkpoints. The lab was full at midnight when Lab 4 was due. Sometimes you spent hours debugging only to find there’s an issue with the hardware. Overall, it’s very time-consuming but rewarding.

**Comment**: Great course. I recommend it for all ECE majors.
