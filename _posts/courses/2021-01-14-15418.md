title: Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming
---
**Number**: 15-418

**Units**: 12

**Why**: Many friends were taking, did not get off waitlist for 15-440 until week 2. I once had a dream to do enter the hardware industry.

**Workload**: 3 hours of lecture most of the weeks; 2-3 days when there's a programming; 5-day final project. It was among the light side of system courses but they added homework now.

**Comment**: This course is surprisingly interesting. The first half was mostly about parallel processing and memory consistency; the second half was about introducing many frameworks and parallel ML. Exam was hard; curve was quite mysterious. Talked a lot about hardware; CS majors be aware.
