**Number**: 57-173

**Units**: 9

**Why**: General Education.

**Workload**: Does not exist until final.

**Grading**: There were quizzes but the questions were simple. The midterm was open book collaborative. The essay question on the final were given in advance, along with a list of terms we needed to know. I realized that I didn't need it and switched to P/NP, but all of the people I knew got an A.

**Comments**: There were a lot of words I didn't understand as an international student. The grader didn't care about spelling according to a friend, though.
