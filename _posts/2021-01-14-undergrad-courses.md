title: Undergrad Courses
description: A list of courses used to fulfill my B.S. in ECE. I'll try to add comments and reviews.
---

## Senior Fall
All but one of the courses will count towards the master's degree.

### 82-173 Introduction to Japanese I
9 Units

**Why**: Fulfills PPC in the College of Engineering. My boyfriend was planning to study in Japan.

**Workload**: Most heavy in all the gen-eds I took. Lecture was 3 hours/week; small homework per lecture, 3 compositions, 6(?) dialogue presentations, 1 final project. 6-10 hours per week; 7-8 on average.

**Comment**: This course covers the first half of *82-171: Elementary Japanese I*. It was a lot of work, though. We learned basic grammar like "blah is blah", "from... to ...", or "because". Every grammar item was being practiced a lot. If you plan to take Japanese later on, I think you might be better off taking the 12-unit 82-171 instead.

## Junior Fall
This was a hard but rewarding semester. I don't have any regrets about course selection.
### 15-418 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming
12 Units

**Why**: Many friends were taking, did not get off waitlist for 15-440 until week 2. I once had a dream to do enter the hardware industry.

**Workload**: 3 hours of lecture most of the weeks; 2-3 days when there's a programming; 5-day final project. It was among the light side of system courses but they added homework now.

**Comment**: This course is surprisingly interesting. The first half was mostly about parallel processing and memory consistency; the second half was about introducing many frameworks and parallel ML. Exam was hard; curve was quite mysterious. Talked a lot about hardware; CS majors be aware.

### 18-349 Introduction to Embedded Systems
12 Units

**Why**: A senior told me Lab 4 is an intro to OS. I wanted to see if I really want to suffer through OS. It's also an ECE software area course.

**Workload**: My partner and I spent at least 3 nights for every lab, including checkpoints. The lab was full at midnight when Lab 4 was due. Sometimes you spent hours debugging only to find there’s an issue with the hardware. Overall, it’s very time-consuming but rewarding.

**Comment**: Great course. I recommend it for all ECE majors.

### 18-220 Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits
12 Units

**Why**: ECE Core.

**Workload**: Homework takes 3-6 hours; lab takes 2-4 hours. Very manageable overall.

### 66-221 Topics of Law: Introduction to Intellectual Property Law
9 Units

### 57-173 Survey of Western Music History
9 Units

### 57-188 Repertoire and Listening for Musicians

## Junior Spring
I was warned that Comp Arch is the ECE version of OS (definitely not true). As a result, I picked many easy classes that I was not interested in.
