title: About Me

Hi there! My name is Yating Han and I'm a final-year student at Carnegie Mellon. Although I'm technically a master's student, I still say I'm a senior to appear younger.

## Education
Here is a list of schools I attended:
* Master's: *Carnegie Mellon University* [[english]](https://www.cmu.edu/)
* Bachelor's: *Carnegie Mellon University* [[english]](https://www.cmu.edu/)
* High School: *Qingdao No.2 Middle School* [[chinese]](http://www.qderzhong.net)
* Middle School: *Qingdao No.26 Middle School* [[chinese]](http://www.qd26.qdedu.net/index.aspx)
* Elementary School: *Qingdao Experimental Primary School* [[chinese]](http://www.ssy.qdedu.net/index.aspx?pkId=479)

As the Top 1 high school in the City of Qingdao, my school failed to get its English name right. Nice job out there.

I graduated a semester early for college, and I am on the track of graduating with a master's degree in four years. I highly discourage anyone without major constraints to do the same; there are many courses I wanted to take (like OS) but I didn't have the time.

For a list of classes I took every semester, check out [this post]({% post_url 2021-01-14-undergrad-courses %}).

## Work
### Teaching Assistant
I was a 5-time TA for [a major CS course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/) at CMU, from Spring 2019 to Fall 2020. The instrustors are [Iliano Cervesato](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iliano/) and [Dilsun Kaynar](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dilsun/). The course is required for all SCS and ECE students and a few other majors as well. It teaches data structures and algorithms.

In Spring 2021, I will TA [18-447](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=18-447_introduction_to_computer_architecture) Computer Architecture. The instructure is [James Hoe](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=home). It's great to serve my home department in my last semester. We'll see how it turns out for a software person. 

I've included all the links for book-keeping. Find me!

### Internship 
I was an intern at Hulu. I worked in the Video org on developing an internal testing tool for the Live Pipeline team. My project was in Python, but I also worked on patching some Go code and creating a front-end using Bootstrap and JQuery.

The project was not hard in terms of coding. The main challenge is to figure out how exactly to simulate a live channel. I had to talk with 3 different teams in order to get an idea. Thankfully, everyone was very supportive and I managed to get a prototype up and running. There was another intern on our team who helped me a lot as well (thanks Jeff). It was a wonderful experience despite it being remote and 8-week. 

Hulu was such a great place to work that I was planning to take the return offer immediately. Yet, circumstances have been made and I've accepted a position at another great company. Nevertheless, I am very thankful for my mentor/manager Frank and everyone who helped me along the way. **If you are someone who is looking for new grad SDEs, I'm glad to introduce you to my fellow interns at Hulu.**

## Other Jobs
I worked as a Web Developer at CMU Abstract Lab. There, I built a front-end visualization tool for satellite simulations. It was based on CesiumJS.

When I was a freshman, I worked as a Desk Attendant at Rez over winter break. That the first job in my whole life. The hourly rate was more than many TA and RAs :)

## Community Service 
My biggest contribution to the CMU community is debugging code for 500 freshmen per semester, as stated in the TA section. I also taught lab and recitations and I think I did okay.

I participated in World Vision Singapore Famine Camp 2016. We didn't have any food for 30 hours. The Camp contained many tasks like working for food, cleaning for elderly people, and fighting with other groups with resources. The world is indeed small. Our team was in the [highlight video](https://youtu.be/v-0Logx9IDU?t=125) at 2:05.

When I was in Grade 10, I went to a pay-for-play Habitat trip in Sichuan Province, China. It was raining heavily all week and we did maybe 2 days of work. Nevertheless, it was quite touching to see how people lived there.
